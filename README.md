# Assembler

Assembler is a project that implements an assembler for a simple risc language. It provides both a graphical interface and a command-line version, allowing users to convert assembly instructions into machine-readable hexadecimal code. This project can serve as an educational tool to explore the inner workings of an assemblerâ€”from parsing source code to generating output.

## Contents

- **GUI_Assembler.py**: A Python script that launches a graphical user interface for assembling code. It lets you load assembly files, view the output, and interact with the assembler easily.
- **assemblerr.cpp**: A C++ implementation of the assembler intended for command-line usage.
- **assembler rules.pdf**: A detailed document that outlines the assembly language syntax, supported instructions, and overall design of the assembler.
- **input.txt**: A sample assembly code file used to test and demonstrate the assembler.
- **hexfile.hex**: A sample output file containing the hexadecimal machine code generated by the assembler.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **For the Python GUI Assembler:**
  - Python 3.x installed on your system.
  - Tkinter (usually bundled with Python).

### Setup and Usage

#### Using the GUI Assembler (Python)
1. **Clone the repository:**
